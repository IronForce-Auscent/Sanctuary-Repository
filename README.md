# Welcome to the Sanctuary

Welcome to the Sanctuary, your one-stop repository of space- and multiversal-related research. Managed by the Northland Foundation, we ensure 100% secure access to all our resources... or at least, that was what was assumed, until a recent cyberattack on the Sanctuary caused critical information to be leaked to the public.

To combat this issue, the Foundation has released an open-source version of the Sanctuary, and issued a challenge to the public.

```
Find the flags hidden within the website, and turn them in to the Foundation's Quality Assurance Division to receive bountiful rewards and recognition for your efforts!
```

## Author's Notes

It is highly recommended that you go through and exploit the website yourself first, before looking through the listed flag locations and solutions. If you encounter
issues with certain vulnerabilities, please open a pull request describing your issue and steps for reproduction.

A list of flags can be found [here]() and the solutions to the flags can be found [here]()
